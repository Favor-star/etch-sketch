 #CAUTIONS

the JS file named `<index.js>` is mostly non-used; 

It contains codes that I started writing by. 
so after analysing the idea, and even checking what others have done,
 I decided to update the whole codes into a new file named `<script.js>` .
 
Even the `style.css` file is mostly unused even though it contains some useful codes
that  are still functional to our webpage.
